I added an embedded youtube video as an enhancement. 
Any enhancements that are not listed and linked on the Enhancements page will not be assessed. 

Your Enhancements page must list the enhancements you have implemented. For each feature briefly
explain:
 how it goes beyond the basic requirements of the assignment
 what code is needed to implement the feature
 if you have sourced your technique from a third party the source of this technique (e.g. URL) must be
cited.
 a hyperlink to where you have applied that extension in your Web site (this is need so the tutor can
quickly assess your enhancements during the demonstration).
 All enhancements must be able to run on Firefox. Make sure you check this.
To gain a full 5 marks for a feature it must:
• Be relevant to / enhance the content of the Web site
• Be well described (as explained above)
• Be non-trivial. Judging this will be at the sole discretion of your tutor/marker. As a guide if the
enhancement has only taken a couple of lines of code it is likely to be trivial.
